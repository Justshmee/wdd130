      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose for this site is to have a place to put my reviews for games. Knowing that reviews for games come from one person, and knowing what games they like could help you decide what games to buy.</p>
      <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Mostly for family and friends to take from and see if games they are interested in that I've played are worth buying.</p>

      <!-- --------Content Section -------------- -->
      <hr />
      <h2>Content</h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>My homepage will be fairly simple. It will have 2 images that are links to the 2 different child pages. One image being of a board game, which leads to a list of reviews for board/cards games, like Uno or The Game of Life. The next image would be of a video game, which leads to video game reviews whether it be PC, Playstation, or mobile, i’ll try and get reviews for most games I play.      </p>
      <p>Images for the Home page</p>
      <img src="images/baord-game-link.webp" alt="image for homepage" />
      <img src="images/video-game-link.jpeg" alt="image for homepage" />

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>To the first child page which will be the board games section. It will have different sections in it like board games and card games. In those sections it will have pictures of games I’ve played with their names, somewhere near them, then when you hover over them they will show a review out of 5 stars and a small description on why, will probably be small jokes honestly.      </p>
      <p>Images for the Page 2</p>
      <img src="images/uno.webp" alt="image for page" />
      <img src="images/chess.jpeg" alt="image for page" />

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>The second child page will be for video games. It will be very similar to the first child page where there will be different sections, this time by genre. It will have the different pictures that when you hover over them it will show the review and a small description on why.      </p>
