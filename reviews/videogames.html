              4/5 Very fun movement, boss fights, and a nice story, not only in
              the main story but the dlc's as well. Though creativity for boss
              fights are lacking.

              5/5 A very expressive and fun 3D platformer. While I feel the base
              games customization is not creative, the dlcs give you plenty more
              to work towards and have fun with.

              4/5 A game with creative dungeons and amazing music. Where the
              importance of your bonds with other people help you throughout the
              game. While the original ending lacks in many places, the Royal
              ending makes the game end in a more satisfying way.

              4/5 Great music and beautiful landscape with a cast of powerful
              characters and strong bonds formed between them. The combat is
              probably the best in the whole series. Despite a semi confusing
              story, the game still shines.

              4/5 With a cast of expressive and funny characters and a beautiful
              wordl for you to travel, this game is also one that shines in its
              long line of games. Despite the music being amazing, the length of
              the game, with a small music pool compared to other jrpg's, you
              can get tired of it easily.

              2/5 While a game I have really enjoyed playing in the past it's
              hard to get back into it now, with old content being deleted to
              make room for new content, instead of making a whole new game, if
              you miss something in the past you'll be lost on what to do.

              play reach and since I heard people really like this one I was
              excited to play. In the end I was sad but also don't regret
              playing it.
